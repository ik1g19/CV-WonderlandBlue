\section*{Personal Statement}

I am a recent graduate of the University of Southampton and am excited to begin my career in industry. Throughout my studies, I have been passionate about problem solving and have developed interests in the cyber security and computer vision sectors, I am specifically proud of my work as a computer vision researcher for user position tracking systems at Audioscenic.  My web links provide a more detailed look at my university projects and practical experience. I am very passionate about teaching myself new things and will always try to find a way to pick up new skills - so a new and challenging project is always welcome. I am personable and a team player and have experience with working in several Agile/SCRUM project development life cycles through multiple University projects.

\section{Other information}

\subsection{Review}

Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
